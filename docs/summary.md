The game field is represented by the player ship, targets, and black and white holes. The player can control the position of his ship and produce the energy pulses. The targets and black and white holes appear at a random location and have a limited lifetime. The black and white holes have gravitational effects on the energy pulses of the player (but **not** on the player ship). The game goal is to hit as many of the targets as possible with the energy pulses.
